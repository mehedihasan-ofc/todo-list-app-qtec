# Todo List App

## Description

This is a simple Todo List application built using React (with Next.js), Tailwind CSS for styling, and Headless UI for modals. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting tasks. Each task has a status (completed or incomplete) and a priority (low, medium, or high) which is indicated by different colors in the task list. Additionally, the application provides basic task management functionalities and a filtering system based on priority.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS:** JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, providing a flexible and efficient way to create interactive UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to style your components, offering a highly customizable and responsive design approach.
- **Headless UI:** A collection of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components for React, designed to work out of the box with Tailwind CSS. Headless UI is particularly useful for creating accessible modal dialogs.
